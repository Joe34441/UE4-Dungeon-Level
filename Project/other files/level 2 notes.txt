(level 2)

Level starts at end of level 1, the defeat enemy drops a key to the only door leading out of the area. This leads to a corridor, where walking
forwards over the clearly unstable ground causes you to fall into 1st main room.

1st main room, you fall onto a wrong tile and trigger the first enemies to attack. There are seperated blocks of rows of tiles on the floor,
stepping on the wrong tile will trigger the coffins on either side of that row to open, releasing the skeleton enemy. Each tile contains a
symbol, the correct symbol for each block of tiles is on either side, clearly illuminated.

1st main room leads into elevator room, taking you further down into the dungeon.

Elevator leads into a corridor with axes swinging from side to side, very easy to tranverse but must be cautious to not get hit.

Coming from that corridor leads you into the 2nd and main puzzle room. To escape, you go through a tunnel behind a locked jail door.
To unlock this door, you must use the correct lever at the top of the level. If the player also uses a wrong lever, more enemies will be released.
To reach these levers, you must find and pickup a missing lever piece to activate a drawbridge. To reach this lever piece, you must complete a
puzzle by rotating three 'blocks' showing a different symbol such that all symbols are facing an identical symbol. Getting this wrong will cause
projectiles to fire towards the player when they use the lever with the wrong combination active.

Going through the tunnel leads you outside the castle, to a horse drawn carriage waiting for you to make your escape.
